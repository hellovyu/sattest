# SatSchool

Some code to define a template for SatSchool "Working with Data" module

To run the entire application,

`streamlit run app.py`

You should put your Earth Engine token in the Streamlit Secrets (see advanced settings): `EARTHENGINE_TOKEN = "TOKENHERE"`

Looking to run a minimal working example of the quiz? Check out the `quiz.py` gist [here](https://gist.github.com/Spiruel/caddce0dcc0a609c804dfc4dfb20f608).
